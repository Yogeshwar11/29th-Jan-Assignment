    "Q.4 \n",
    "A. REST\n",
    "1. A client-server architecture composed of clients, servers, and resources.\n",
    "2. Stateless client-server communication, meaning no client content is stored on the server between requests. Information about the session’s state is instead held with the client.\n",
    "3. Cacheable data to eliminate the need for some client-server interactions.\n",
    "4. A uniform interface between components so that information is transferred in a standardized form instead of specific to an application’s needs. This is described by Roy Fielding, the originator of REST, as “the central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style from other network-based styles.”\n",
    "5. A layered system constraint, where client-server interactions can be mediated by hierarchical layers.\n",
    "6. Code on demand, allowing servers to extend the functionality of a client by transferring executable code\n",
    "\n",
    "B. SOAP\n",
    "1. Web services security (WS-security): Standardizes how messages are secured and transferred through unique identifiers called tokens.\n",
    "2. WS-ReliableMessaging: Standardizes error handling between messages transferred across unreliable IT infrastructure.\n",
    "3. Web services addressing (WS-addressing): Packages routing information as metadata within SOAP headers, instead of maintaining such information deeper within the network.\n",
    "4. Web services description language (WSDL): Describes what a web service does, and where that service begins and ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Shortcomings of SOAP\n",
    "1. Resource-consuming. Due to the larger size of an XML-file and a payload created by the massive structure of a message, a SOAP API requires a larger bandwidth. Sometimes, this trade-off isn’t worth dealing with. Simply put, it’s slow to process these strings of tags that XML messages abound with.\n",
    "2. Hard learning curve. Being protocol-based, building SOAP API servers requires knowledge and understanding of all protocols you may use with it. Developers dealing with building these types of APIs should dive deep into all processes inside the protocol with its highly restricted rules.\n",
    "3. Lacks flexibility. We’ve mentioned that a SOAP API serves as a strict contract between a client and a server. With this in mind, this rigid SOAP schema requires additional effort to add or remove the message properties on both sides of the communication, the server and the client. It makes updating requests and responses a tedious process and slows down adoption."
